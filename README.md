Not Enough Furniture: ReCrafted
=======

Not Enough Furniture: ReCrafted is a remake, from scratch, of the old Not Enough Furniture Mod. The Mod is no longer an Addon, it is now its own thing.
The Mod is also no longer made in MCreator (yay), it has moved to being coded.

Not Enough Furniture: ReCrafted focuses on adding survival friendly furniture to Minecraft. From things like Chairs, Tables, Couches, and more!

Versions
============
The Mod is currently available for NeoForge 1.21.1, with a Forge 1.20.1 version planned. There are currently no plans to port to other mod loaders/versions.
